# Three.js-X-Wing-Demo

I built this X-Wing Fighter information page to learn the basics of the Three.js Library. The basic premise is that you can see a 3D X-Wing Fighter and click on different components to get some basic information. 

I've learned how to import objects, create objects, import a picture as a background and interaction and manipulation of imported objects. 

This has been my first time working with any JS library rather than using vanilla JS.

I added in an easter egg based on Disneys new The Mandarloria TV Show. When the rebel alliance symbol is clicked, 'the child' appears on top of the X-Wing Fighter!
